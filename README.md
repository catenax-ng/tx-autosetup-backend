### How to run

Managed Service Orchestrator is a SpringBoot Java software project managed by Maven.

When running, the project requires a postgresql database to be available to connect to. Per default configuration the application expects postgres to run on localhost on port 5432.

You can find the standard credentials as well as further database configurations int the application.properties file in the resource folder.


### Prerequisites
- JDK18
- Postgres 13.2
- Docker
- kubeapps
- Helm chart for Package installation

### Steps
1. Clone the GitHub Repository - https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/managed-service-orchestrator
2. Get your instance of postgres running
3. Setup your project environment to JDK 18
4. Start the application from your IDE.

## Database
## Flyway
The scripts are in the folder: resources/flyway.<p>
File naming: <b>Vx__script_name.sql</b>, where x is the version number. <p>
When there is a need to change the last script, it is necessary to create a new script with the changes.
